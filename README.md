# ASML
Anti-Social Micro-log
This is just a little window to write logs that are saved to an archive file, "asml00.txt" by default.
So you can write posts, like a micro-blog, that you don't want to tell the world about.
I personally use it to save posts that I decide not to post, or notes.
It only saves a post if you press a button. Perfect for rage quiting!
I am on mastodon @AdamOnza on mastodon.online

New in 01b:
Added context menu. Now one can right-click, and open a menu that does stuff like copy and paste, which makes it easier to save posts one writes on micro-blogging sites, but decides to not post!
